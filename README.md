# Floating note
What MS sticky notes should have been.

## Why
I was driven mad by the MS sticky notes,
as it support some rich text functions,
but never implemented it in a reasonable way.

I want a sticky-note-like quick note taking app,
but with markdown.
So comes this repo

## How to use

### Create a shortcut
Creating the short cut not only gives a quick access,
but also start the app without distracting browser toolbars.
Optional but highly suggested

1. Go to https://urfdvw.github.io/floating-note
2. Using chrome as example

    - or go to https://urfdvw.github.io/floating-note
2. Start typing and it renders
3. [Ctrl-Enter] ([Cmd-Enter] on mac) to hide the editor
